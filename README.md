# BC CMS

BC CMS is a full stack PHP/Javascript/SCSS framework with CMS for websites and other browser based projects.

* Allows rapid and lean, no-nonsense web development
* For working with everchanging designs and constant client feedback
* Keeps codebase clean and robust, which leaves time to focus on end product, not on technical problems
* Reusable and extendable panels (page partials), grouped to the modules
* Follows HMVC pattern - keeps storage access, business logic, templating, frontend logic and styling separated for each panel
* Headless CMS option through built in json interface
* Robust and tested tools to work with dynamic page partials and API calls
* Makes possible for designers and users to upload content and start building pages even in the early stages of project
* Fast. Even without optional built-in caching
* Built in image optimisation and optimal loading, automatic webp serving
* Built in SCSS (SASS3) compiler
* Built in externals optimiser, only scripts and styles really needed on page are loaded
